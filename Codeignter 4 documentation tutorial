 Installation codeigniter with Composer and run following command:-
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

1 composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter --no-dev // command

It is creating folder with name appstarter in your htdocs / www folder you can rename and use it.

2. other comman you can use to creat folder as you wish as well as run time.
composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter newcod4 --no-dev // commmand

After run above command then again run next composer update command:=

=> Whenever there is a new release, then from the command line in your project root:
composer update

=> If you used the “–no-dev” option when you created the project, it would be appropriate to do so here too,
composer update --no-dev.

=>Initial Configuration & Set Up
================================================
1. Open the app/Config/App.php file with a text editor and set your base URL. If you need more flexibility, 
the baseURL may be set within the .env file as app.baseURL=”http://example.com”.

2. If you intend to use a database, open the app/Config/Database.php file with a text editor and set your database settings. 
Alternately, these could be set in your .env file.

=> Local Development Server
=====================================
CodeIgniter 4 comes with a local development server, leveraging PHP’s built-in web server with CodeIgniter routing.
You can use the serve script to launch it, with the following command line in the main directory:

php spark serve

This will launch the server and you can now view your application in your browser at http://localhost:8080.
OR
http://localhost/codeigniter4/public/

=> How to create controller and use
=========================================
I have created a controller with the name Test and extends BaseController not as old CI_controller

<?php

namespace App\Controllers;
class Test extends BaseController
{
	public function test()
	{
		echo "My test";
		die;
		return view('welcome_message');
	}

}

=>Route Definitions
================================

As above mention url will be 
http://localhost/codeigniter4/public/test/test -- it is correct and working
But I can change url esily in CI4 go to the route file and open change here
- path -\app\Config\Routes.php

$routes->get('/', 'Home::index');
$routes->get('/test', 'Test::test');

=>How to enable parse error or error reporting
===============================================
First of all rename ENV file which is in root folder with .env name(.)
And add uncomment remove # and then added development mode.

 CI_ENVIRONMENT = development
